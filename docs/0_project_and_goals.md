# CORE BOOKING ENGINE - BACKEND

## Concept
CORE BE is an application that aims to being the bridge between users and service providers, allowing the system to be a sort of "Amazon of services".

The application was built from the ground-up with a generic approach to the industries.
The idea is to have a central backend system with a generic infrastructure, and different business-specific frontends.

# Structure
The central backend consists of models for representing people, models for representing services and models for representing bookings.
See [models and relations](1_models_and_relations.md).


TODO mention that payers can be either company or person.
TODO further describe the non-generic stuff
